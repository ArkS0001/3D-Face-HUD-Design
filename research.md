### üìò Key Research Papers

#### 1. **HeadNeRF: A Real-time NeRF‚Äëbased Parametric Head Model**

A neural radiance field (NeRF) tailored for human heads.

* Renders high-fidelity head images in real time (\~25‚ÄØms per frame).
* Supports view-angle and expression control‚Äîideal for dynamic communication systems. ([themoonlight.io][1], [arxiv.org][2])

#### 2. **Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular 4D Facial Avatar Reconstruction**

Uses NeRF + morphable head model to reconstruct talking heads from RGB video.

* Enables novel viewpoints and realistic reenactment without specialized rigs. ([reddit.com][3], [arxiv.org][4])

#### 3. **Neural radiance fields-based holography \[Invited]**

Combines NeRF view synthesis and a CNN to produce holograms directly.

* Novel pipeline: 2D images ‚Üí NeRF ‚Üí depth map ‚Üí hologram, bypassing traditional diffraction computation. ([researchgate.net][5], [arxiv.org][6])

#### 4. **Three-dimensional capture system for holographic display**

(Conference: Ultra‚ÄëHigh‚ÄëDefinition Imaging Systems III, Feb¬†2020)
Describes a light‚Äëfield camera with microlens array for 3D capture‚Äîsuitable for holographic rendering. ([researchgate.net][7])

#### 5. **End‚Äëto‚Äëend real‚Äëtime holographic display based on real‚Äëtime capture**

(Optics Letters, Apr¬†2023)
A CNN maps binocular parallax captures to full holograms in real time‚Äîno offline optical simulation. ([researchgate.net][5])

#### 6. **Holographic Video Communication System (2021)**

Implements a thin, transparent holographic optical element (HOE) for virtual image projection with proper eye contact. ([jstage.jst.go.jp][8])

### üîß How These Apply to Your Pipeline

| Research Element                  | Your Pipeline                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NeRF-based view synthesis**     | For generating novel intermediate views between camera angles in real time.                       |
| **Light-field/microlens capture** | Enables volumetric scene capture that can feed into hologram generators.                          |
| **CNN hologram mapping**          | Converts captured views directly into displayable holograms.                                      |
| **HOE & volumetric displays**     | Essential for projecting the 3D floating face with realistic optics.                              |
| **Real-time constraints**         | Papers focus explicitly on low-latency reconstruction (\~25‚ÄØms), suitable for live communication. |
