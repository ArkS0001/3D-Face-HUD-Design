## Objective

Design a heads-up display (HUD) that presents a 3D holographic face by capturing multiple camera angles and compositing them into a convincing real-time view, so that the viewer feels they are talking to a floating 3D face rather than a flat interface.

## 1. System Overview

1. **Capture Rig**: Array of synchronized cameras arranged around the subject's head (e.g., semicircle or full circle).
2. **Calibration & Synchronization**: Calibrate intrinsic/extrinsic parameters and synchronize frames across cameras.
3. **Processing Pipeline**:

   * **Preprocessing**: Undistort & color-correct each camera feed.
   * **3D Reconstruction / View Synthesis**: Generate a novel view or select nearest pre‑rendered angle.
   * **Rendering**: Composite output to the HUD or projection medium.
4. **Display Module**: Transparent display or Pepper's‑ghost enclosure to create volumetric illusion.
5. **Viewer Tracking (Optional)**: Track viewer head position to adjust rendered perspective in real time.

## 2. Hardware Setup

| Component               | Recommendation                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cameras                 | Global-shutter USB3 cameras, 60–120 FPS                |
| Lens                    | Wide-angle (35–50mm equivalent)                        |
| Synchronization Trigger | Hardware trigger generator (e.g., Arduino, Blackmagic) |
| Mounting                | Adjustable rig with fixed known positions              |
| Display                 | Holographic pyramid or transparent OLED panel          |
| (Optional) Depth Sensor | To assist reconstruction (e.g., Azure Kinect)          |

## 3. Software Pipeline

1. **Calibration**

   * Use **OpenCV** to compute camera matrices & distortion coefficients.
   * Perform checkerboard or ArUco-based calibration across all cameras.

2. **Frame Capture & Sync**

   * Capture images via multi-threaded ingestion.
   * Tag frames with timestamps and buffer in memory.

3. **View Synthesis Options**

   * **Pre‑Recorded Playback**: Record subject from N discrete angles, then select nearest video based on viewer’s pose.
   * **Multi-View Stereo (MVS)**: Reconstruct point cloud or mesh each frame (e.g., **COLMAP**, **OpenMVS**).
   * **Neural Rendering**: Use **NeRF** variants for real-time novel view synthesis.

4. **Perspective Selection**

   * Estimate viewer’s head pose via **MediaPipe** / **Dlib** on a secondary camera.
   * Map pose to desired virtual camera and fetch/render correct view.

5. **Display Output**

   * Render output frames via **OpenGL** / **Unity3D** to the HUD device.

## 4. Implementation Steps

1. **Prototype Pre‑Recording Approach**

   * Set up 8 cameras in a semicircle.
   * Record a short sequence of head turns.
   * Implement head-pose estimation on viewer side.
   * Switch between pre‑recorded feeds at runtime.

2. **Scale to Real-Time Reconstruction**

   * Integrate COLMAP/OpenMVS for near real-time 3D reconstruction or use a GPU-accelerated NeRF (e.g., Instant-NGP).
   * Optimize for <50ms latency.

3. **Integrate Display**

   * Build a Pepper’s-ghost stage using acrylic and fold mirrors.
   * Align rendered output to appear floating in space.

4. **Refinement & QA**

   * Test under varying lighting and background.
   * Adjust color balance and latency compensation.

---

## 5. Challenges & Considerations

* **Latency**: Real-time reconstruction can be compute‑intensive.
* **Parallax & Occlusion**: Ensuring correct occlusion boundaries between different views.
* **Synchronization Drift**: Hardware trigger ensures frame alignment.
* **Display Brightness & Viewing Angles**: Holographic illusions depend on ambient lighting.

---

## 6. Next Steps

* Choose between simple pre‑recorded switching vs. full volumetric capture.
* Source or build the capture rig.
* Prototype end‑to‑end with a minimal camera array.
* Iteratively refine reconstruction quality and display setup.
